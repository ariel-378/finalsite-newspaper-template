// ============================================================================
//  CENTERSPREAD CONTENT — the print-edition pieces shown on centerspread.html.
//  Editors manage these from the "Centerspread" tab in the editor dashboard;
//  this file is just the shipped starting content (like articles.js).
//
//  Piece types: "poem" (stanzas), "prose" (paragraphs), "image" (a painting or
//  photo, not tied to an article). Any piece may carry an optional
//  `reveal: { summary, answer }` — a "reveal the answer" toggle.
//  For poem/prose `body`: a blank line separates stanzas/paragraphs; a single
//  newline separates lines within a stanza.
//
//  Sample content for the demo site: invented pieces from the invented East
//  High School. Set `pieces: []` to start clean, or replace them one at a time
//  from the Centerspread tab.
